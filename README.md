# Input Clear
A jQuery plugin that makes clearing text input fields much faster and easier
When a user types into a text input field, an "X" button appears on the right of the field that
clears the input for the user.
## Usage
Include jquery.inputClear.js after jQuery is loaded.

To enable your input field to use this plugin, simply call inputClear() on the target element:

    jQuery(yourInputElement).inputClear();
    
A quick way to enable this for all text inputs on the page is to use following line in your js file:

    jQuery("input[type=text]").inputClear();
